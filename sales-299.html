                    <span class="bold">THINK BETTER, LIVE BETTER</span> will be an immersive and invaluable experience taking place over one action-packed day in beautiful Austin, Texas.
                </p>
                <p class="shedule-text">What better way to kick off your day than with a series of morning keynote conversations that take you deep into the "Think Better, Live Better" topics -- ones that will serve as powerful, actionable moments of awakening. Then it's off to intimate workshops to actually put these strategies to work, followed by an open, interactive panel discussion with your presenters.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">Just like you, we've also been to conferences where the sessions are so jam-packed that there isn't even time for a washroom break or to grab a cup of coffee.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">Think Better, Live Better will absolutely NOT be like that.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">We've set things up to be as attendee-friendly as possible - with regular breaks, plenty of time for lunch (which is provided!), time to apply what you'll be learning about, time to share your experiences and most importantly - time to come have fun, and connect with others who want the same things out of life as you do.</p>

In just a short time I rise from depression, increased productivity in work and personal life, and so much more passion for what I do.</span> I have started waking up at 5am, established morning and evening rituals, simplified the way I use my calendar, learned how to capture and schedule tasks, written my ideal week, gone paperless, and I love the feeling of having my frog done by 10am!

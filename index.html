Then it's off to intimate workshops to actually put these strategies to work, followed by an open, interactive panel discussion with Marc and Angel Hack Life founders, Marc and Angel Chernoff and Asian Efficiency operators, Thanh Pham and Aaron Lynn.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">Just like you, we've also been to conferences where the sessions are so jam-packed that there isn't even time for a washroom break or to grab a cup of coffee.</p>

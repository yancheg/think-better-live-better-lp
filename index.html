                    <span class="bold">THINK BETTER, LIVE BETTER</span> will be an immersive and invaluable experience taking place over one action-packed day in beautiful Austin,Texas.
                </p>
                <p class="shedule-text">What better way to kick off your day than with a series of morning keynote conversations that take you deep into the “Think Better, Live Better" topics -- ones that’ll serve as powerful, actionable moments of awakening. Then it's off to intimate workshops to actually put these strategies to work, followed by an open, interactive panel discussion with Marc and Angel Hack Life founders, Marc and Angel Chernoff and Asian Efficiency operators, Thanh Pham and Aaron Lynn.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">Just like you, we've also been to conferences where the sessions are so jam-packed that there isn't even time for a washroom break or to grab a cup of coffee.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">Think Better, Live Better will absolutely NOT be like that.</p>
                <p class="shedule-text">We've set things up to be as attendee-friendly as possible - with regular breaks, plenty of time for lunch (which is provided!), time to apply what you'll be learning about, time to share your experiences and most importantly - time to come have fun, and connect with others who want the same things out of life as you do.</p>
